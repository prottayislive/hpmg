        <p>
          Stretching keeps the muscles flexible, strong, and healthy, and we need that flexibility to maintain a range of motion in the joints. Without it, the muscles shorten and become tight.

              <li>Cobra stretch.
                Lie on your stomach and place your hands flat beneath your shoulders. Tuck your elbows in by your sides and gently raise your head and chest, keeping your hips and groin on the bed. If it feels comfortable, you can go a little deeper by lifting your tummy off the bed too. Remember to relax your neck and shoulders. Hold the stretch for 15-20 seconds and when youâ€™re ready, gently lower back down.
              </li>

                Knees-to-chest.
Lying flat on your back, bring one knee to your chest and hold it in position with your arms or hands. You should feel a nice stretch in your lower back. If it feels comfortable, you can also do this stretch by bending both knees at the same time.
              </li>

              <li>Spinal twist.
                Lying on your back, raise one of your knees, and gently roll it over to the opposite side. Make sure both of your shoulders stay in contact with the bed at all times. If it feels comfortable, stretch one arm out to the side, keeping it in line with your shoulders, and slowly turn your head to face your outstretched arm. You should feel the stretch on the sides of your upper body and your lower back. Breathe deeply and repeat on the opposite side.
              </li>

              <li>
                Upper back stretch.
Sit on the edge of your bed, with your feet flat on the floor. Interlock your fingers and reach forward, bending from your middle back. Stretch with your hands forward at shoulder level. You should feel the stretch between your shoulder blades.
              </li>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                Shoulder stretch.
Relaxing your shoulder blades back and down, reach one arm across your body and gently use your other arm to deepen the stretch. Hold for 15-20 seconds and repeat on the other side.
              </li>
              <li>

                Side stretch.
                Stand with your feet hip-width apart and clasp your hands above your head. Gently lean your body to one side, feeling a deep stretch along the side of your body. Hold for 10-15 seconds and repeat on the other side.

              Wellness is often confused with terms such as health, wellbeing and happiness.
              While there are common elements among them, wellness is distinguished by not
              referring to a static state of being (i.e., being happy, in good health, or
              a state of wellbeing). Rather, wellness is associated with an active process
              of being aware and making choices that lead toward an outcome of optimal
              holistic health and wellbeing.
            </p>
